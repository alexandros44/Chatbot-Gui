# Node-Python Chatbot

*In this repository you have a **Chatbot** with `html/css` GUI.*

### Description

\- In this **Repository** you have a chatbot that has a Graphical User Interface with the help of html/css.

In particular, I used `Python/Tensorflow` to train the Chatbot and used `NodeJs` in order to make the web app. 

The communication between Python and NodeJs is being made with the help of `Flask`.

## What needs to be done:

1. Train the Chatbot.
 1. Create a dataset.
 2. Process the dataset.
 3. Train the `Model`.
 4. Create the `API.`
2. Make the Web Application.
 1. Design the Application.
 2. Implement the Design.
 3. Make the Communication between **Front and backend**.
 4. Display the backend answer.
